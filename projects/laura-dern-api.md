## About

Laura Dern API is an open source API dedicated to our LGBTQ icon Laura Dern. You will have access to all her shows and movies, images, characters, and years.

## How

I used Node.js and Express for the back-end, PostMan and MongoDB for managing the database (since this is a small-scale API). The front-end is written in components, which means pages are dynamically changed based on the database. I deployed the site to Heroku.
