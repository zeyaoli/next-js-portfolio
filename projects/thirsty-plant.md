## Ideation:

Originally, I thought about the gesture SWIPE on our phone. I'm interested how people turned a single gesture into something related to consumerism and promotion (e.g. swipe to watch a Youtube video or get to a link to an item for sell). However, the sketches that I came up with were not convincing enough for the criticism of swiping. Yet I kept thinking about the shape of plant that I drew on my initial sketch. Maybe I could create something with the plant because it looks so organic and common in our life? I asked myself.

Then I had the idea of making the plant thirsty for water, just like how people are thirsty for love/attention/approval on social media.

I got some wasted cardboard from the NYU MakerSpace, where I work at every day, and made a cardboard installation out of it. From the process of making this cardboard leaf, instead of cutting it into a weird leaf shape, I realized that it will be easier to laser cut a whole piece of leaf and place the LED light above it. Then cut a few pieces to mask the "fragment" part on top of the LED strip. I showed my prototype to a few friends and they all like how it looks like so far!
