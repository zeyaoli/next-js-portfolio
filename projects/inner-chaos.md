"Inner Chaos" is an Augmented Reality game developed by Zeyao, Shirley, and Collin. The game explores the relationship between the physical world at NYU Shanghai and the digital world on the phone. The player uses the phone camera to scan the everyday object to equip the "backpack" and uses the backpack's equipment to fight the enemy in the digital world. Players also need to find essential items to enter the digital world. The goal of the game is to beat the enemy and save the school.
