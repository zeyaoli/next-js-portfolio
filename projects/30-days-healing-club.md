### 30 Days Healing Club is a journal site with daily prompts for people who have gone through loss and leads them on a healing journey for 30 days.

## Background

In September 2020, my grandpa passed away due to cancer. Because of COVID, I can't go home to see him one last time or attended his funeral. It was the first time I experienced losing someone that I loved so profoundly from my life. Shortly after, I separated from my partner. The double loss that I had made me question how I can heal myself and let go of what I lost.

Over the time that I develop my idea, the news about Asian Hate was spread across the country. 8 Dead in Atlanta Spa Shooting; Brutal attack on Filipino woman; Chinese woman got shoveled to the ground. I did not just experience the personal loss but also received a sense of loss from my community. Many of my friends expressed their feeling of loss to me and made me think about what I can do not just to help myself but also other people within my community.

And this screenshot inspired me. It's a screenshot from this popular game Animal Crossing. The villager Kiki says, 'Sometimes, all it takes i a good friend to remind you of all the things you like about your life...' It made me realize that I want to be that friend for myself and the people I know who have been going through the loss.

### Just as the villager can heal you in the virtual world, I want to build a platform for people to support each other in an anonymous group.

## Journal

Journaling page is the core function of the site. I tried to recreate the traditional journal by adding functions like dragging and dropping image to your journal, and toggling between text and draw.

I researched how people went through their loss and came across the seven stages of grief, which Elizabeth Kubler-Ross developed in 1969. It contains stages like Shock and Denial, Depression, Acceptance, etc. Based on the seven stages of grief, I created five categories for 30 days prompts: Past/Pain, Emotions, Self-discovery, Relationships, and Future.

And for specific prompts, I read a lot of fiction, articles, poems, and even songs about dealing with loss and healing and got inspired by it. Such as The Ability To Cry, Where Reasons End, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous. Prompts are directly related to these materials.

## Reward

The advent calendar inspires the reward system of the site. An advent calendar is a unique calendar that people buy before Christmas. Each day, you open one box to unlock a surprise to build anticipation for the festival.

Similarly, after submitting your journal, you will enter the page to collect the badge and get the support and read other club members' responses to the prompt. Also you can see five different icons here to represent the categories, so members will have the motivation to keep the journal process going.

## Community

I developed part of the site and sent the beta version to an online community that I was in. We did a group journaling session for an hour with piano music in the background. It was very reflective and soothing. And I got the responses below on my beta site. Club members can send reactions to other posts.

## Personalized Collection

After completing 30 days' journey, each club member will get a personalized journal collection that shows why you were here at the beginning, what you got hurt by, and your stats on the site, and the amount of love you received from the club member. Also, there are reminders about creating boundaries with other people and how to grow better.
