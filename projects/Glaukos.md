Glaukos Corporation is an ophthalmic medical device company focused on developing and commercializing breakthrough products and processes designed to transform the way we treat glaucoma, one of the world's leading causes of blindness.

This work is under PINT,inc, a web agency that I am currently working at. Over the course of 14 weeks, I lead the development process with fellow developer Vanna Luu.
