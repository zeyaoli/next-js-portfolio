<p>RubiconMD is a web-based eConsult service that enables primary care providers to quickly and easily discuss their cases with top specialists, so they can provide better careâ€”improving the patient experience and reducing costs.</p>

<p>The client reached out to PINT and wanted a new website that reflects on their current company stage. I collaborated with their designers on the design files and took charge of the whole web development process. Besides building the marketing pages, I designed and developed the CMS for their news and webinars system to help their marketing team manage content more efficiently.</p>

<p>After launching, the site increased 30% web performance and grew 40.4% monthly visits.</p>
